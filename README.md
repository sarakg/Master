# Master's Thesis 

This page contains the R-scripts for my master's thesis. They are marked sequential, with 1 first, followed by 2, 3, 3.1 and so on.  
To replicate my findings, download this main page as a zip file.  
Make sure you have Rtools installed beforehand. If not, it can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
