# Master's Thesis 

This page contains the R-scripts for my master's thesis. They are marked sequential, with 1 first, followed by 2, 3, ... 6.1 and so on.  
To replicate my findings, download this main page as a zip file.  
Make sure you have Rtools installed beforehand. If not, it can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

I have used the V-Dem dataset version 10, and downloaded this via GitHub. Since I downloaded this dataset, it has been updated and the version I used is no longer available there. However, the dataset can be found here https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/archive/previous-data/v-dem-dataset/. Choose Country-Year: V-Dem Full+Others to download the dataset as an R-file.
